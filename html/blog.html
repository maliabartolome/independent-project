                  <p>Her love is pure. Her affection is beautiful. Her dependency is the blessing that gives me purpose.</p>
                  <p>This moment and moments like this are what nurture my heart. I am as dependent to her as she is to me.</p>
          ⁣        <p>And I believe that’s the beauty of our friendship.</p>

                  <p>There’s something so beautiful about watching two worlds blend together.⁣</p>
                  <p>Bringing Nika to Portland has been a lengthy process where I waited until I believed it to be the right time to share a new life with her.⁣</p>
                  <p>This moment captured is just that. The new life I wanted to share with her.⁣</p>
                  <p>Introducing new friends and a new life style.</p>
                  <p>She’s 7. We have less time to spend with each other as the days pass by. But I want moments like this for her and well, selfishly for myself.⁣</p>
                  <p>These are beautiful moments. Watching her enjoy her day. Playing in the water. Chasing after her friends. Hiking through stunning cliffs.⁣</p>
                  <p>As if we were home. But only now, we are home.</p>

                    <p>Laying under the palms. Watching the leaves sway back and forth.</p>  ⁣
                    <p>The wind in one constant breath.</p>
                    <p>I’ll miss these moments. I think they’re so beautiful.⁣</p>
                    <p>The contrast from blue to green. Sharp points to the clear sky.</p>
                    <p>I could lay beneath the palms and watch them in this moment forever.</p>
