        <p>Welcome to the world of Malia Bartolome. That's truly exciting!</p>
        <p>I'll be honest, I've genuinely struggled with writing about myself, my entire life. For whatever reason, I've found it difficult to sit in front of a screen and type away about my character.</p>
        <p>I'm a great writer, don't get me wrong. But I write about food, people, and places -- <em>not</em> me, myself, and I.</p>
        <p>This wesbite is intented to share my newly acquired desire to develop and create. After building out my first website over 3 years ago, I let my fulltime career hinder me from progressing my skillset to develop.</p>
        <p>I found inspiring in the people around me. I work for a <strong>tech</strong> company where I'm exposed to a handful of resources for development. With the encouragement and support I received from my community, I've put aside all my excuses and I'm here with you today.</p>
        <p>So I invite you to join me on this journey, to learn, grow, and develop with Epicodus.</p>
